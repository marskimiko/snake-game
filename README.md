# Welcome
Hello and welcome to my snake game application! I'm excited to share it with you ðŸ˜ƒ


# Project Description: 

Snake Game is an application for anyone who misses the good old days of playing this game on their Nokia phone. I hope this gives you a sense of nostalgia and transports you back in time for a moment.

- Upon opening the game it takes you to the homepage with instructions to push the 'spacebar' to start the game
- Once you start playing the game will keep score of how much food you have eaten in the top left corner
- Once you lose it will display your highest score in the right corner and this will only change if you are able to beat the score
